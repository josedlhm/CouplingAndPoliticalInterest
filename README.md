# CouplingAndPoliticalInterest

Using longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP), this paper studies how relationships affect interest in politics. The results suggest that partners matter in a predictable way: coupling with more politically engaged partners leads to higher levels of interest, while entering relationships with politically unengaed people has the opposite effect. However, the size of these effects vary across genders. While men experience greater increases in interest after partnering with a highly interested person, women appear to suffer greater decreases after coupling with less interested partners.
